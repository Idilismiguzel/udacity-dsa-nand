## Flattening a nested linked list

Suppose you have a linked list where the value of each node is a sorted linked list (i.e., it is a _nested_ list). Your task is to _flatten_ this nested listâ€”that is, to combine all nested lists into a single (sorted) linked list.

First, we'll need some code for generating nodes and a linked list:


```python
# Use this class as the nodes in your linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return str(self.value)
    
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, head):
        self.head = head
        
    def append(self, value):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(value)
            return
        node = self.head
        while node.next is not None:
            node = node.next
        node.next = Node(value)
```

Now, in the cell below, see if you can solve the problem by implementing the `flatten` method.

>Hint: If you first create a `merge` method that merges two linked lists into a sorted linked list, then there is an elegant recursive solution.


```python
def merge(list1, list2):
    # TODO: Implement this function so that it merges the two linked lists in a single, sorted linked list.
    pass

class NestedLinkedList(LinkedList):
    def flatten(self):
        # TODO: Implement this method to flatten the linked list in ascending sorted order.
        pass
```

Here's some code that will generate a nested linked list that we can use to test the solution:


```python
# First Test scenario
linked_list = LinkedList(Node(1))
linked_list.append(Node(3))
linked_list.append(Node(5))

nested_linked_list = NestedLinkedList(Node(linked_list))

second_linked_list = LinkedList(Node(2))
second_linked_list.append(4)

nested_linked_list.append(Node(second_linked_list))
```

### Structure
`nested_linked_list` should now have 2 nodes.  The head node is a linked list containing `1, 3, 5`.  The second node is a linked list containing `2, 4`.

Calling `flatten` should return a linked list containing `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.


```python
solution = nested_linked_list.flatten()
assert solution == [1,2,3,4,5]
```

### Solution

First, let's implement a `merge` function that takes in two linked lists and returns one sorted linked list.  Note, this implementation expects both linked lists to be sorted.


```python
def merge(list1, list2):
    merged = LinkedList(None)
    if list1 is None:
        return list2
    if list2 is None:
        return list1
    list1_elt = list1.head
    list2_elt = list2.head
    while list1_elt is not None or list2_elt is not None:
        if list1_elt is None:
            merged.append(list2_elt)
            list2_elt = list2_elt.next
        elif list2_elt is None:
            merged.append(list1_elt)
            list1_elt = list1_elt.next
        elif list1_elt.value <= list2_elt.value:
            merged.append(list1_elt)
            list1_elt = list1_elt.next
        else:
            merged.append(list2_elt)
            list2_elt = list2_elt.next
    return merged
```

Let's make sure merge works how we expect:


```python
linked_list = LinkedList(Node(1))
linked_list.append(3)
linked_list.append(5)

second_linked_list = LinkedList(Node(2))
second_linked_list.append(4)

merged = merge(linked_list, second_linked_list)
node = merged.head
while node is not None:
    #This will print 1 2 3 4 5
    print(node.value)
    node = node.next
    
# Lets make sure it works with a None list
merged = merge(None, linked_list)
node = merged.head
while node is not None:
    #This will print 1 2 3 4 5
    print(node.value)
    node = node.next
```

Now let's implement `flatten` recursively using merge.


```python
class NestedLinkedList(LinkedList):
    def flatten(self):
        return self._flatten(self.head)

    def _flatten(self, node):
        if node.next is None:
            return merge(node.value, None)
        return merge(node.value, self._flatten(node.next))
```


```python
nested_linked_list = NestedLinkedList(Node(linked_list))
nested_linked_list.append(second_linked_list)
flattened = nested_linked_list.flatten()

node = flattened.head
while node is not None:
    #This will print 1 2 3 4 5
    print(node.value)
    node = node.next
```

### Computational Complexity
Lets start with the computational complexity of `merge`.  Merge takes in two lists.  Let's say the lengths of the lists are $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$. Because we assume the inputs are sorted, `merge` is very efficient. It looks at the first element of each list and adds the smaller one to the returned list.  Every time through the loop we are appending one element to the list, so it will take $N_{1} + N_{2}$ iterations until we have the whole list.

The complexity of `flatten` is a little more complicated to calculate.  Suppose our `NestedLinkedList` has $N$ linked lists and each list's length is represented by $M_{1}, M_{2}, ..., M_{N}$.

We can represent this recursion as:

$merge(M_{1}, merge(M_{2}, merge(..., merge(M_{N-1}, merge(M_{N}, None)))))$

Let's start from the inside.  The inner most merge returns the $nth$ linked list.  The next merge does $M_{N-1} + M_{N}$ comparisons.  The next merge does $M_{N-2} + M_{N-1} + M_{N}$ comparisons.

Eventually we will do $N$ comparisons on all of the $M_{N}$ elements. We will do $N-1$ comparisons on $M_{N-1}$ elements.

This can be generalized as:

$$
\sum_n^N n*M_{n}
$$
